## An all in one web application for academic collaboration


The purpose of this diploma thesis is to design and build an application for collaboration of members of the academic community offering chat, video calling, calendar and cloud storage services. This idea arose when the need for digital tools to aid the educational process became more apparent (in the midst of a pandemic). Web software development tools were used for this purpose as well as application programming interfaces. The purely academic nature of the application is intended to deliver prestige and credibility both to the application itself and to its members. More specifically, the user will be able to create teams and groups in which he will be able to communicate with other academic members by accessing a service suite built and designed based on the Google API.
